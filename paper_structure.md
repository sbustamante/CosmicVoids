1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brief introduction to the problem of voids in a cosmological context. Bibliography review
and recent relevants works.


2. The simulation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical details of the used simulation (Bolshoi), with descriptions of halos 
catalogues (BDM and FOF). All halo samples are defined here as well.


3. Algorithms to quantify the cosmic web
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed description of each web classification scheme (V-web and T-web). Furthermore, it
is presented a nowel approximation to select an optimal threshold parameter by using mean 
(median?) densities of sheet (void?) regions.


4. Finding bulk voids
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, it is presented a FOF-like scheme used to find bulk void regions, where each void
cell catalogued as a void by the web scheme and the optimal threshold parameter is used 
as an input "particle" in the FOF algorithm. To optimize this scheme, a percolation 
analysis is also performed in order to reduce this numerical phenomenon, where a null
threshold parameter is found to be the best way to overcome percolation. 


5. Statistics of voids and influence over dark matter halos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throghout this section is presented a classification of voids according to their shape, 
this is reached by using the reduced intertia tensor and the respective eigenvalues. it
is found, completely anisotropic voids are preferred in the LCDM cosmological model.
It is also performed an analysis over the influence of voids over the physical properties
of dark matter halos, as their mass or their spin parameter. It is found dark matter halos
are preferentially distributed near to large volume voids, while a minor fraction of them 
are relatively further to smaller bulk voids.
