\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%*************************************************************************


The spatial distribution of galaxies describes a web-like pattern, the 
so-called cosmic web. Today it is understood that such configuration is 
driven by gravitational instabilities. ...

\section{The Simulation}
\label{sec:the_simulation}
%*************************************************************************


As it was previously mentioned, we use an unconstrained cosmological 
simulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to identify the possible large scale 
environment of the Local Group. This is a similar approach to the one already 
used by \SRKED{[reference here]}.



The Bolshoi simulation follows the non-linear evolution of a dark matter 
density field on a cubic volume of size $250$\hMpc sampled with $2048^3$ 
particles. The cosmological parameters in the simulation are 
$\Omega_{\rm m}=0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, $h=0.70$, $n=0.95$ and 
$\sigma_{8}=0.82$ for the matter density, cosmological constant, 
dimensionless Hubble parameter, spectral index of primordial density 
perturbations and normalization for the power spectrum. The mass of each 
particle in the simulation is $m_{\rm p}=1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun.
We identify halos with two algorithms, the Friends-of-Friends \SRKED{
[reference here]} algorithm and the Bound Density Maximum algorithm.

\section{Algorithms to quantify the cosmic web}
\label{sec:algorithms_cosmic_web}
%*************************************************************************



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The tidal web (T-web)}
\label{subsec:Tweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The first algorithm  we use to identify the cosmic web is based upon the
diagonalization of the tidal tensor, defined as the Hessian of a 
normalized gravitational potential  


%.........................................................................
%Tidal Tensor
\begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x_{\alpha}\partial x_{\beta}}
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where the physical gravitational potential has been rescaled by a factor 
$4\pi G\bar{\rho}$ in such a way that $\phi$ satisfies the following 
equation



%.........................................................................
%Poisson
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\phi = \delta,
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where $\bar{\rho}$ is the average density in the Universe, $G$ is the 
gravitational constant and $\delta$ is the dimensionless matter 
overdensity.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The velocity  web (V-web)}
\label{subsec:Vweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



We also use a kinematical method to define the cosmic-web environment in 
the simulation. The method has been thoroughly described in XXX and 
applied to study the shape and spin alignment in the Bolshoi simulation 
here XX. We refer the reader to these papers to find a detailed 
description of the algorithm, its limitations and capabilities. Here we 
summarize the most relevant points for the discussion. 



The V-web method for environment finding is based on the local shear 
tensor calculated from the smoothed DM velocity field in the simulation.
The central quantity is the following dimensionless quantity 


%.........................................................................
%V-Web Definition
\eq{V_web}
{
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_0}\pr{\frac{\partial v_{\alpha}}
{\partial x_{\beta}}+\frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}}
}
%.........................................................................
where $v_{\alpha}$ and $x_{\alpha}$ represent the $\alpha$ component of 
the comoving velocity and position, respectively. $\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ 
can be represented by a $3\times 3$ symmetric matrix with real values,
that ensures that is possible to diagonalize and obtain three real 
eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} > \lambda_{2}>\lambda_3$ whose sum (the trace of
$\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$) is proportional to the divergence of the local 
velocity field smoothed on the physical scale ${\mathcal R}$. 



The relative strength of the three eigenvalues with respect to a threshold
value $\lambda_{th}$ allows for the local classification of the matter 
distribution into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and peaks, 
which correspond to regions with 3, 2, 1 or 0 eigenvalues with values 
larger than $\lambda_{th}$. Below we shall discuss a novel approach to 
define an adequate threshold value based on the visual impression of void
regions, furthermore we study other possible values based on other visual
features of the cosmic web.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The cosmic web in Bolshoi}
\label{subsec:web_in_simulations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both established schemes to quantify the cosmic web depend on continuous 
and smooth physical quantities, i.e the peculiar velocity field and the 
density field. To calculate these quantities, a discretization over the 
volume of the simulation is performed, so all the properties are reduced 
to single values associated to discrete cells. According to this, we 
divide the overall volume into $(256)^3$ cells, so each cell has an 
associated comoving cubic volume of $0.98 \mbox{ Mpc h}^{-1}$. Finally, in 
order to reduce possible effects due to the discretization process, a 
gaussian softening is performed between neighbour cells.



Once defined the numerical details about both classification schemes, we
shall analyse the dependence on the threshold value $\lambda_{th}$ for 
each one. For this, we shall use the distribution of dark matter halos as 
tracer of the underlying matter field in order to be more consistent with
available observational data. First, we analyse distributions of mass and 
peculiar velocity in order to assign typical values to each type of 
environment. In the figure \ref{fig:typical_mass_velocity} we calculate 
both distributions for web schemes and using the FOF catalogue of the 
simulation. Thick lines correspond to the median of the distribution and 
filled regions limited by dashed lines correspond to quartiles $Q_1$ and 
$Q_3$, it means, $50\%$ of all halos are within such regions for every 
\lth value and for each type of environment. We rather use median and 
quartiles as measure of dispersion because there are some very unusual and 
extreme values that makes the usual analysis based upon means and standard 
deviations less reliable.



A first interesting feature of the figure  \ref{fig:typical_mass_velocity} 
is the median mass for each region. In the case of the T-web, although 
dispersions of the distribution of mass for each environment are 
considerably overlapped each other, the median value is very 
well-differentiated among types of environment, indicating that it is 
possible to assign typical values of mass to each region, and being 
consistent with expectations, where low mass halos are typical in voids 
until high mass halos in knots. For the case of the V-web scheme, all
medians and dispersions are completely overlapped, specially for values 
grater than the optimal \lth value, indicating that it is not possible to
assign typical mass ranges to each environment as quantified by this 
scheme. For peculiar velocities, this situation is opposite, where V-web
scheme is much more adequate to assign typical distributions of velocity
to each environment. Although T-web also makes a differentiation in the 
distributions of velocity, this is very slight compared with the V-web 
case. These results can be explained by appealing the physical origin of 
each web scheme. As T-web is based upon the Hessian matrix of the 
potential field, it is expected all quantities related to the potential, 
like density field and distribution of halos mass, are well-differentiated 
among each region, while for the V-web scheme, based upon the shear 
velocity tensor, all dynamical quantities, as the peculiar velocity field 
and the distribution of halos velocity are alike expected to be 
well-differentiated among regions as quantified by this scheme.



Finally, we also calculate typical distributions of the density and 
peculiar velocity fields on the volume cells associated to each type of 
environment, obtaining completely analogous results. Furthermore, we use a 
BDM catalogue of the simulation as well, obtaining very similar conclusions.

\section{Finding bulk voids}
\label{sec:bulk_voids}
%*************************************************************************


According to the recent growing interest in studying galaxy formation in 
low-density regions as cosmological tests, classifying void regions is 
becoming an important task in cosmology. Most of those classification 
schemes for voids in cosmological simulations are based upon the density 
field, setting a cut off value below which some region becomes a void 
\SRKED{[references]}. Some more advanced classification schemes are based 
on Voronoi tessellations applied over the tracer particles of the 
simulation in order to compute the density field. Then, through a watershed 
transform, a hierarchy of void regions are found \SRKED{[references, 
ZOBOV algorithm]}.


As has been established \SRKED{[references]}, both schemes presented in
the previous section (V-web and T-web) for classifying the cosmic web 
present many advantages compared with classification schemes based
completely upon the density field, e.g. a more robust description of the
dynamic a kinematic of the cosmic web, a more reliable quantification of 
the visual impression, among others. With the aim of exploiting all of 
these advantages, we propose here a novel approach to classify voids in
cosmological simulations based entirely on the web schemes.


The original version of the T-web scheme \SRKED{[reference, Hahn]} was not
successful at reproducing the visual impression of the cosmic web, 
however, with the introduction of a threshold parameter \SRKED{[reference, 
Forero-Romero]}, this scheme, and even the V-web \SRKED{[reference, 
Hoffman]}, improved enormously. As this free parameter controls the visual 
impression provided by each scheme, phenomenons like percolation depends 
on it as well. Percolation is one of the key features of the structure of 
void regions, indicating how voids are merged among them, and how they 
permeate all the cosmic web.


In order to overcome the percolation of voids in our classification scheme,
we introduce the fractional anisotropy as defined in \SRKED{[reference, 
Libeskind]}.


%.........................................................................
%Fractional anisotropy
\eq{fractional_anisotropy}
{ FA = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{ \frac{ (\lambda_1 - \lambda_3)^2 + 
(\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)^2 + (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2}{ \lambda_1^2 + 
\lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2} } }
%.........................................................................
where the eigenvalues are taken from any of the two web schemes. This 
index, such as it is defined, allows quantifying the local anisotropy 
degree of the cosmological environment, where $FA=0$ corresponds to highly
isotropic regions and $FA=1$ anisotropic ones.


In the figure \ref{fig:FA_field} we calculate the FA field over the 
simulation for both web schemes. The first interesting feature of this
figure is the degeneration presented for knots and central regions of 
voids, where both of them exhibit low to middle values of the FA, 
indicating a high isotropy regarding the physical property quantified by 
each web scheme, i.e. the density field for the T-web and the peculiar 
velocity for the V-web. For the T-web, the FA field around knots presents 
a very narrow distribution, whereas for the V-web the same distribution is
more spread. This can be explained appealing to the low dispersion of the 
density field with respect to the peculiar velocity in highly non-linear 
regions like knots. For more linear regions like voids, the behaviour of 
the FA field is quite similar between both schemes, what is consistent 
with the equivalence of the T-web and the V-web in the linear regime 
\SRKED{[reference, Hoffman]}.


According to the classification scheme adopted for the cosmological 
environment, voids are regions where 
$\lambda_3\leq\lambda_2\leq\lambda_1\leq\lambda_{th}$, this implies that
the boundaries of void regions are controlled completely by the $\lambda_1$
eigenvalue of the web scheme and the threshold value. Therefore, as we 
increase the threshold value $\lambda_th$, all voids grow up progressively 
through contours of $\lambda_3$ field until certain critical value where 
voids are very large so the visual impression is no longer reliable.




%*************************************************************************
\section{Properties of voids}
\label{sec:properties}
%*************************************************************************


Once defined the proper scheme to classify bulk voids in the simulation,
we proceed to analyse their physical properties, like the inertia values,
the density and peculiar velocities profiles as calculated over the grid 
and profiles of number of halos.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Shape of voids}
\label{subsec:shape_voids}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Quantifying the shape of voids is gaining importance due to cosmological 
tests such as the Alcock-Paczynski test \SRKED{[Sutter, et.al (2012)]}, so 
we compute here the reduced inertia tensor through the next expression in 
order to determine shape distributions of bulk voids.


%.........................................................................
%Reduced inertia tensor
\eq{ReducedIntertia}
{ \tau_{ij} = \sum_l \frac{ x_{l,i}x_{l,j}  }{R_l^2} }
%.........................................................................
where $l$ is an index associated to each cell of the current region, 
$i$ and $j$ indexes run over each spatial direction and finally 
$R_l$ is defined as $R_l^2 = x_{l,1}^2 + x_{l,2}^2 + x_{l,3}^2$. All 
positions are measured from the respective geometric center of each void.


The eigenvalues of the reduced inertia tensor, i.e. the principal moments
of inertia, are used to quantify the shape of each bulk void. They are 
denoted as $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ such that $\tau_1 \leq \tau_2
\leq \tau_3$. In Figure \ref{fig:distro_inertia} we show the computed
distributions for $\tau_1/\tau_2$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3$ for voids larger 
than 8 cells in order to avoid statistic fluctuations due to small regions.
We rather calculate histograms for these ratio quantities instead of each 
single value in order to avoid using an arbitrary normalization. For both 
schemes, it can be noticed that the shape distribution is completely 
spread out, thereby indicating a non-preferred geometry of void regions, 
which is in agreement with the well established high anisotropy of matter 
flows associated to this type of region. 


For a better quantification, we also perform a classification of the shape 
of voids by setting a threshold in the analysed ratio quantities. An 
anisotropic or tri-axial shape correspond to voids where $\tau_1/\tau_2 < 
0.7$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3 < 0.7$, where there is not any symmetry among the
principal directions. We find about $57.2\% \sim 61.0\%$ of total voids 
consistent with this shape, for the T-web and V-web respectively. A 
pancake or quasi-oblate shape is associated to voids where $\tau_1/\tau_2 
< 0.7$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3 > 0.7$. We found $13.1\% \sim 17.9\%$ of 
consistent voids. Filamentary or quasi-prolate voids satisfy $\tau_1/\tau_2 
> 0.7$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3 < 0.7$, with $25.4\% \sim 18.1\%$ of all voids.
Finally, isotropic or quasi-spheric voids are found when $\tau_1/\tau_2 
> 0.7$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3 > 0.7$, with $4.2\% \sim 3.1\%$ of total voids 
compatible with this shape. The threshold value of $0.7$ adopted here for
the ratios of the moments of inertia is just for illustrative purposes, 
where such distinction is rather fuzzy and continuous. However, the 
previous analysis allows us to conclude that voids are quite asymmetric 
structures.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Density profile of voids}
\label{subsec:density_voids}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Describing the density profiles of voids is quite important in order to 
compare and match simulation with observational surveys, allowing possible
constrains for different cosmology models \SRKED{[Hamaous, et.al 2014]}. 
Here, and taking into account the previous results, we rather use an 
ellipsoidal approximation to describe and fit the shape of bulk voids, so 
we use the next ellipsoidal radial coordinate to describe density profiles.


%.........................................................................
%Ellipsoidal radial coordinate
\eq{radial_coordinate}
{
r^2 = \frac{x^2}{\tau_1^2} + \frac{y^2}{\tau_2^2} + \frac{z^2}{\tau_3^2},
\ \ \ \ 0\leq r \leq 1
}
%.........................................................................
where we take the principal moments of inertia $\{\tau_i \}$ as the 
lengths of the principal axes of the ellipsoid and each one of the 
cartesian coordinates as measured in the rotated frame of each void.


We use the same analytic density profile that \SRKED{[Hamaous, et.al 2014]} 
to fit the numerical density profiles of our voids.


%.........................................................................
%Density profile
\eq{density_profile}
{
\delta_v(r) = \delta_c\frac{1-(r/r_s)^\alpha}{1+(r/r_v)^\beta}
}
%.........................................................................
